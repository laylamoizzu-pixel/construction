# AI Assistant Branding Guidelines

To ensure consistent user experience and brand identity across the Smart Avenue platform, all AI-powered assistants must follow these naming conventions.

## The "Genie" Rule

All AI assistants, whether general or specialized, **must include "Genie" as part of their name**.

### Current Assistants
- **Genie**: The primary Shopping Master assistant.
- **Genie Stylist**: The personal fashion assistant.
- **Genie Gift Finder**: The gift concierge assistant.
- **Genie Assistant**: The admin-side configuration interface.

### Guidelines for Future Assistants
1.  **Prefix or Inclusion**: The name "Genie" should ideally be a prefix or a prominent part of the feature name (e.g., "Genie Home Decorator", "Genie Support").
2.  **Personality**: Assistants should maintain the helpful, "master of shopping" persona established by the original Genie.
3.  **UI Consistency**: Use the `Sparkles` icon from `lucide-react` when referencing Genie assistants in the UI.

## Implementation Checklist
When adding a new assistant:
- [ ] Ensure the UI label in the navigation includes "Genie".
- [ ] Use "Genie" in the initial greeting/welcome message.
- [ ] Update the `AdminSidebar` if the assistant has administrative configurations.
- [ ] Add the new assistant to this documentation.
